# railway-tester

This repository contains code and documentation for my thesis. It is about testing the [MoDeS3](http://modes3.inf.mit.bme.hu/) project.

Using a DSL language, created in Xtext, descriptions can be written for railway situations. Based on these descriptions, JUnit tests can be generated automatically for different test levels.

## Prerequisites:
+ Java 1.8
+ Eclipse
+ Eclipse plugins:
  - Xtext
  - Xtend
